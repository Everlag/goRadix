A simple example of LSB(Least Significant Bit) Radix sort in go.

Interestingly, we are within 75% of the std sort for massive slices but fall to 50% as fast for smaller slices.

Possible extensions could be adding SIMD via go's support for asm or switching to MSB sort and dividing work among available cpus.

This naive implementation benches as follows on a i5-2500k at stock clock, the standard 'sort' package is provided for comparison.
